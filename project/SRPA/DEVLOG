- Implemented latin hypercube sampling function, pyDOE external library is nolonger required;
- Boundary for q_fd, defined as q_fd_ubound and q_fd_lbound (upper and lower limit);
- Now output plot for peak steel temperature according to input 'protection_thickness';
- Inputs arguments are packed in a pandas DataFrame object instead of a list;
- Automatically generate fires that satisfies selected percentile Â±tolerance and save as .png and .csv.

- This app, Structural Reliability Probabilistic Analysis (SRPA), utilises Monte Carlo simulation method (i.e. one as
  specified within PD 7974-7). Latin hypercube sampling technique is used for obtaining randomly generated probabilistic
  parameters.
