##/##/2018 VERSION: 0.2 (alpha)
- Script 'main.py' within the SRPA root folder is now runnable directly from command line with prompt to ask user to
  specify work directory;
- 'main.py' now takes multiple work directories via both system argument input and Python input prompt;

02/01/2018 VERSION: 0.1 (alpha)
- Implemented latin hypercube sampling function, pyDOE external library is nolonger required;
- Boundary for q_fd, defined as q_fd_ubound and q_fd_lbound (upper and lower limit);
- Now output plot for peak steel temperature according to input 'protection_thickness';
- Inputs arguments are packed in a pandas DataFrame object instead of a list;
- Automatically generate fires that satisfies selected percentile Â±tolerance and save as .png and .csv.

15/12/2017 VERSION: 0.0 (alpha)
- This script, Structural Reliability Probabilistic Analysis (SRPA), utilises Monte Carlo simulation method (i.e. one as
  specified within PD 7974-7). Latin hypercube sampling technique is used for obtaining randomly generated probabilistic
  parameters.
