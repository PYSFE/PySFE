FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
* Add probablistic parameter upper and lower limits feature for q_fd
* Test with travelling fire curve within func directory
* Implement own latin hypercube sampling function
* Improve vertical and horizontal line plot for graphical output
* Graphical user interface, with multiprocessing ability
* Ouput plot for peak steel temperature

00/00/2017 VERSION: 0.1 (WORKING)
- Implemented newly coded latin hypercube sampling function, pyDOE external library is nolonger required.

15/12/2017 VERSION: 0.0 (alpha)
- This app, Structural Reliability Probabilistic Analysis (SRPA), utilises Monte Carlo simulation method (i.e. one as
  specified within PD 7974-7). Latin hypercube sampling technique is used for obtaining randomly generated probabilistic
  parameters.
