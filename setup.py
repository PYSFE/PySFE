    # This is the name of your pySFE. The first time you publish this
    # package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
    # users can install this pySFE, e.g.:
    #
    # $ pip install sampleproject
    #
    # And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/
    #
    # There are some restrictions on what makes a valid pySFE name
    # specification here:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#name
    name='pySFE',  # Required

    # Versions should comply with PEP 440:
    # https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/
    #
    # For a discussion on single-sourcing the version across setup.py and the
    # pySFE code, see
    # https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/single_source_version.html
    version='1.0.0a1',  # Required

    # This is a one-line description or tagline of what your pySFE does. This
    # corresponds to the "Summary" metadata field:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#summary
    description='Python for Structural and Fire Safety Engineering',  # Required

    # This is an optional longer description of your pySFE that represents
    # the body of text which users will see when they visit PyPI.
    #
    # Often, this is the same as your README, so you can just read it in from
    # that file directly (as we have already done above)

    # This should be a valid link to your pySFE's main homepage.

    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your pySFE is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().
    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:
    #
    #   py_modules=["my_module"],
    #
    packages=find_packages(exclude=['contrib', 'docs', 'tests']),  # Required todo

    # This field lists other packages that your pySFE depends on to run.
    # Any package you put here will be installed by pip when your pySFE is
    # installed, so they must be valid existing projects.

    # For an analysis of "install_requires" vs pip's requirements files see:
    # https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/requirements.html
    install_requires=['peppercorn'],  # Optional todo

    # List additional groups of dependencies here (e.g. development
    # dependencies). Users will be able to install these using the "extras"
    # syntax, for example:
    #
    #   $ pip install sampleproject[dev]
    #
    # Similar to `install_requires` above, these must be valid existing
    # projects.

        'test': ['coverage'],

    # If there are data files included in your packages that need to be
    # installed, specify them here.
    #
    # If using Python 2.6 or earlier, then these have to be included in
    # MANIFEST.in as well.

    # Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may
    # need to place data files outside of your packages. See:
    # http://docs.python.org/3.4/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files
    #
    # In this case, 'data_file' will be installed into '<sys.prefix>/my_data'

    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
    # "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
    # `pip` to create the appropriate form of executable for the target
    # platform.
    #
    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
    entry_points={  # Optional todo
        'console_scripts': [
            'sample=sample:main',
